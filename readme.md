# Pangout - hybrid of Pong & Breakout

## Demo

http://pongout.shtuchkin.com

## Installation

    git clone git://github.com/ashtuchkin/pongout.git
    cd pongout
    
    npm install

    # Launch on http://localhost:5000/
    node index.js

## How to play

2 players required minimum. 
Use your mouse to control the bat. Destroying bricks 
gives you special powers (not in real world).

If someone already plays, you are added to the spectators queue. Wait for your time.
