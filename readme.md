# Pangout - hybrid of Pong & Breakout

## Installation
First, install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) if you havent done that already.
```shell
git clone git://github.com/ashtuchkin/pongout.git
cd pongout

npm install

# Launch on http://localhost:5000/
node index.js
```

## How to play

2 players required minimum. 
Use your mouse to control the bat. Destroying bricks 
gives you special powers (not in real world).

If someone already plays, you are added to the spectators queue. Wait for your time.
